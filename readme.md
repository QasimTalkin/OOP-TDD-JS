# OOP and TDD IN JS

# Some OOP Definitions  
* OOP: Object Oriented Programming is a programming paradigm that uses objects as the primary way of representing data and functionality in a computer program.
* Prototype: A prototype is an object that is used as a template for creating new objects.
* Encapsulation: The idea of encapsulation is to make the code more readable and maintainable.
* Abstraction: Abstraction is the process of hiding the details of a program's implementation from the user.
* Inheritance: Inheritance is the process of eliminating redundant code by inheriting the properties of a parent class into a child class.
* Polymorphism: Polymorphism is the ability of an object to take on many forms.

# OOP
**Object-oriented programming (OOP)** is a popular programming paradigm in which code is organized around objects instead of functions. This approach has the added advantage of helping us follow DRY practices.

# TDD

**Test-driven development (TDD)** is the practice of writing tests before writing code. Here's a snapshot of the TDD process:
* Write a failing test before writing any code.
* Write the minimal amount of code necessary to make the test pass.
* Refactor the code to make the test pass.


# Jest 
* We can use Jest to test our code.
* **Jest** is a testing framework that was created and maintained by Facebookâ€”and it's growing in popularity. Its syntax is easy to understand, and it is extremely popular in Node.js apps.


# jest directory structure 
* __tests__/: contains the tests for the code.
* fileName.test.js: contains the tests for the fileName.js file. `test.js` is a convention for test files.
* Sample test to test fucntion sum of number
```js
describe('sum', () => {
  it('should return the sum of two numbers', () => {
    expect(sum(1, 2)).toBe(3);
  });
});
```

# expect outcome methods 
<style scoped> 
 {font-size : 1.2em;}
</style>
* `any`: The `any` matcher is used to test if a value is anything other than `null` or `undefined`.
* `toBe`: check result to be equal to expected value.
* `isGreaterThan`: check result to be greater than expected value.
* `isLessThan`: check result to be less than expected value.
* `toEqual`: check result to be equal to expected value.
* `toBeTruthy`: check result to be truthy. 
* `toBeLessThanOrEqual`: check result to be less than or equal to expected value.
* `toBeGreaterThanOrEqual`: check result to be greater than or equal to expected value.
* `toBeCloseTo`: check result to be close to expected value.
* `toBeInstanceOf`: check result to be instance of expected value.
* `toBeNull`: check result to be null.
* `toBeUndefined`: check result to be undefined.
* `toBeDefined`: check result to be defined.
* `toBeNaN`: check result to be NaN.
* `toBeFalsy`: check result to be falsy.
* `toContain`: check result to contain expected value.
* `toMatch`: check result to match expected value.
* `toHaveLength`: check result to have length of expected value.
* `toHaveProperty`: check result to have property of expected value.
* `arrayContaining`: check result to contain expected value.

# Mock 
* **Mocks** allow us to fake assumed data, which allows the test at hand to focus only on the logic it cares about. 
* we store mock files in __mocks__ directory.

# running test is jest
* `npm run test`: run test.
* `npm run test ExampleFileName`: run test for ExampleFileName.
* `npm run test -- --watch`: run test and watch for changes.
* `npm run test -- --coverage`: run test and generate coverage, coverage is a tool that generates a report of the code coverage of your project.

# Constructors 
* Constructors are functions that are used to create new objects.
* we can use `new` keyword to create new object.
* the name of the constructor function is preferre to be capitalized. e.g. `Person`
* constructor contains all the properties of the object, e.g: A Car
* `this` is a reference to the object being created.
* `new` keyword is used to create a new object.
```JS
function Car(make='', model, year) {
  this.make = make; // will be set to default '' id no make is passed in
  this.model = model;
  this.year = year;
}
let car1 = new Car('Toyota', 'Corolla', 2000);
```


# SOLID Principles
* Single Responsibility Principle: A class should have a single responsibility.
* the scope of the function should be limited to the class and contain only the code that is required to perform the task.

# Prototype 
* Prototype objects simply inherit the method from the constructor rather than having their own instances of that method.
* Prototype is a way to share methods and properties between objects.
* Why use it? We don't want to create a new object for every instance of the class. We want to share the same methods and properties.
* so we write the function once and then use it in multiple objects.
